        <li><strong>Mobile Device Access.</strong> We may request access or permission to certain features from your

            permissions, you may do so in your device's settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Push Notifications.</strong> We may request to send you push notifications regarding your account or

    </ul>
    <p>This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our application(s), for
        troubleshooting, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>

        any changes to such personal information.</p>

    <h2><strong>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>In Short: We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with
            you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for

        <li><strong>To protect our Services.</strong> We may process your information as part of our efforts to keep our

    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2><strong>3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the
            following third parties.</strong></p>

    <p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during
            negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our
            business to another company.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2><strong>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
            Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</strong></p>

    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
        Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
        other legal requirements).</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
        anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
        stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
        further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2><strong>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical
            security measures.</strong></p>

    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect
        the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
        information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to
        be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
        parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure
        environment.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2><strong>6. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country,
            province, or state of residence.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
        information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to
        withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the
        contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
    <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when
        applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
        lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
    <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at <a
            href="mailto:mehul.patel@dicabs.com">mehul.patel@dicabs.com</a>.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2><strong>7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></h2>
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
        feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online Browse
        activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
        implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
        other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
        tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
        version of this Privacy Notice.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2><strong>8. EMPLOYEE LOCATION TRACKING</strong></h2>
    <p>Our app collects real-time location data of field employees during work hours to support essential business
        functions. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Verifying task completion</li>
        <li>Confirming visits to assigned sites</li>
        <li>Measuring distance traveled</li>
        <li>Ensuring compliance with planned routes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To enable these features, the app requires background location access, even when it is not actively in use. This
        allows continuous location tracking to ensure operational accuracy and accountability. In future updates, we may
        introduce a map-based view showing historical location trails to further enhance transparency and efficiency.
        Location data is used solely for the purposes described above and is not shared with unauthorized third parties.
        Users can manage their location permissions through their device settings, but disabling background location
        access will impair key functionality of the app.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2><strong>9. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</strong></p>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
        "Revised" date at the top of this Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may
        notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We
        encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
    </p>
